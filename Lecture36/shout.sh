# There's no need to create a script. 

# shout is use to enable or disable shell options.

# Example, when you type in terminal:  cd /Docunents
# it will give us an error becuase o the mistyped word (Docunents)

# If you want to avoid this, just type: shout -s cdspell (to check all the available shell options,
# just type shout, or shout -[s][u] [TAB] [TAB]), and it will automatically correct mispelled words,

# so if you type cd /Docunents again, it will work even though "Docunents" is wrongly typed.

# shout -s enables an options, while shout -u disables it. Type shout --help for all the options (are
# really few, like 5 or 6)
